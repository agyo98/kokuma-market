The arguments for the tool "GENERATE_PRD" are empty ("content":""), but the tool expects some content to generate the Product Requirements Document (PRD). Please provide the necessary content or description for the PRD in the "content" field. For example:

{"content":"This PRD should detail the features, user stories, and acceptance criteria for the new login system with multi-factor authentication."}

Once you provide the content, I can help generate the correct arguments.
