## Description

# Feature Implementation: Theme Switch

You are a front-end developer AI working on our Next.js 15 dashboard. Implement a theme toggle (light/dark) feature. Provide detailed guidance as follows:

## User Journey
User lands on any page → Clicks theme toggle in navbar → Application switches theme → Choice persists on page reload → Toggle remains in chosen state

Display this flow with arrows:  
Landing Page → Click Toggle → Apply Theme → Save Preference → Reload with Same Theme

## Functional Requirements
1. A toggle button in the top navigation to switch between light and dark.
2. Current theme should apply to all components (colors, backgrounds, text).
3. Persist user preference in localStorage.
4. Default to system preference on first load.

## Data Flow
1. UI Toggle emits an event →
2. ThemeContext updates theme state →
3. Write preference to localStorage →
4. Next.js root layout reads localStorage or system setting on mount →
5. Provide theme state via React Context to styled components.

Provide:
- Code snippets for ThemeContext (with React.createContext).
- Hook `useTheme` to read/write theme.
- Integration in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Tailwind CSS configuration changes for dark mode.

Output the implementation as TypeScript code files ready to drop into the scaffolded project.

MUST Guidelines:
- only implement what is written in prompt.
- tidy first.
